Here is a simple C program that asks the user to enter two numbers and then computes their sum, difference, product, and quotient:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    float num1, num2;  
    float sum, difference, product, quotient;

    // Input from user
    printf("Enter first number: ");
    scanf("%f", &num1);
   printf("Enter second number: ");
   scanf("%f", &num2);

        printf("Quotient: %.2f\n", quotient);
    } else {
        printf("Quotient: Cannot divide by zero.\n");
    }

    // Display results
    printf("Sum: %.2f\n", sum);
    printf("Difference: %.2f\n", difference);
    printf("Product: %.2f\n", product);

    return 0;
}
